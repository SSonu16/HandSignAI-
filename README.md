HandSignAI – Real-Time Sign Language to Text Converter

HandSignAI is an AI-powered real-time application that translates sign language gestures into text using computer vision and deep learning techniques. The project aims to bridge the communication gap between the hearing-impaired community and others by providing an accessible, fast, and accurate solution for gesture recognition.

Features
1)Real-Time Detection: Converts hand signs into text instantly using a live webcam feed.
2)Deep Learning Model: Built with CNN / Transfer Learning for accurate gesture recognition.
3)Sign Language Support: Recognizes alphabets (A–Z), numbers, and commonly used gestures.
4)User-Friendly Interface: Displays detected signs and corresponding text on screen.
5)Lightweight and Fast: Optimized for real-time performance on standard hardware.
6)Accessibility Focused: Helps improve inclusivity by enabling seamless communication.

Tech Stack
Python
OpenCV – For hand tracking and real-time image processing
TensorFlow / Keras – For training and deploying the gesture recognition model
NumPy and Pandas – Data preprocessing and handling
Matplotlib / Seaborn – Visualization of training results
Streamlit / Tkinter (optional) – For building a user interface

How It Works
Capture – The webcam captures the user’s hand signs.
Preprocess – OpenCV isolates and processes the hand region.
Predict – The trained deep learning model classifies the gesture.
Translate – The recognized sign is displayed as text in real-time.

Use Cases
Assistive Communication – Helps people with hearing or speech impairments communicate more easily.
Education – Useful for learning sign language interactively.
Research – Can be extended for multilingual sign language datasets.
Integration – Potential integration with chat apps, mobile apps, or IoT devices for accessibility.

Future Enhancements
Add support for full words and sentences (not just alphabets).
Implement voice output (text-to-speech) for detected signs.
Expand to multiple sign languages (e.g., ASL, ISL, BSL).
Improve accuracy with transformer-based or vision-language models.

<h3> INSTALLITATION : </h3>

1)Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/SSonu16/HandSignAI.git
cd HandSignAI

2) Create a virtual environment :
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/Mac
